# Project proposal
TwoWordsOneCup

## Project Description
TwoWordsOneCup is the word game app America has been waiting for! It allows any two users to play a competitive word game where they have to make a new word with the random word that falls out of the virtual cup. The first person to spell a new word from the old word has to place it back into the cup and scores one point. The first player to 10 points wins the round!


## Problem statement
Everyone loves word games, but there are no fun, addicting, competitive word games in existance since WordsWithFriends. 


## How will your project solve this problem?
TwoWordsOneCup will shake up the word game scene by tapping into the creative competitive spirit between two friends to see who can spell a new word faster. The game will be easy to play between two friends or if the user chooses they can play a random opponent. 


## Map the user experience
The user will be prompted to create a login which they will be able to do using a Facebook or other social media login authorization. They will then be taken to a prompt to add friends, and will be given a lsit of suggested friends based on their contacts. They will then be taken to the landing page. The landing page will have a button to start a new game with a friend or random opponent. Once they select they will be taken to the gameboard and play the game! Once the game is over they will be prompted to play again or change opponents. 


## What technologies do you plan to use?
- VueJS: clientside GUI, web/mobile app
- Node: serverside logic, data manipulation
- PostgreSQL: database
- AWS: hosting
- Passport.js: user authentication using facebook login
