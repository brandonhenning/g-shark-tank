## Project Proposal

It came to you in a dream! The simple word game America's been waiting for. You scribble it down in your dream journal, and realize you won't be able to build it on your own. Luckily, you've been crushing the meetup scene, and have a solid network of fellow devs you can ask to help. But you know they're busy. Put together a pitch that convinces them joining your team is worth their time! Update proposal.md with your proposal.

* Project Description: Think "Elevator Pitch". Succinctly, but completely describe what you'll be building
* Problem Statement: What problem is your app solving? Who has it?
* How will your project solve the problem?
* Map the user experience. When the user opens your app, what happens? What information does your app need from your user? What does it output in return?
* List the technologies you plan to use. This should be a complete list, including APIs. Be prepared to defend the items on this list. This means you should research the technologies/APIs, and know why you're planning to use each.
