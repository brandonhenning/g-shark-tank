# Project proposal
Punchr

## Project Description
Punchr is an app that simplifies the tedious process of clocking in and clocking out for employees at a workplace that tracks hours. Users simply login and tap a button to indicate that they are clocking in and when their shift is over they can push a button on their app to indicate they are clocking out. The app has a geolocation feature that ensures employers that employees are truly on the job premises when they clock in. 


## Problem statement
Physically punching in and punching out on a timecard is tedious for employees because they have to physically walk to wherever the punch cards are located. The punch cards are also a very inefficient way for employers to see employees hours because they also have to physically look at the punch card to see a log of in/out times and hours worked. The physical cards can also be misplaced, lost, or stolen. 


## How will your project solve this problem?
Punchr will help make employees lives easier by allowing them to clock in and out on their mobile device and will make employers lives easier and more efficient by allowing real time tracking of hours worked, employees in/out times and currently clocked in employees. 


## Map the user experience
Employees will open the app on their phone and login with their login given to them by their employer. They will then be taken to a landing page that will have their total hours worked for the last pay period and a button to clock in. They press the button and clock in. When their shift is over they press the button to clock out.

Employers will login and be taken to their landing page. It will have a section to create a new employee id and login. It will have a section to see all employees and see their in/out times and hours worked. They will also have a section to see a list of all employees currently clocked in. 

## What technologies do you plan to use?
- Vue.JS: client side GUI and mobile/web app
- Node: server side logic, data handling
- PostgresQL: database, employees, hours etc.
- AWS: hosting
- GoogleAPI: geolocation for employee login to verify on premises
