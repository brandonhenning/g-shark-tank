# Project proposal
SoakMe

## Project Description
SoakMe is an app that simplifies the difficult process of soaking your faded white clothing in bleach water to restore its vibrant white color. Simply login to the app, indicate your address and preferred time of pickup and a SoakMe bleaching partner will pick up your faded clothing and return them to you in less than 4 hrs completely bleached white to perfection! 

## Problem statement
White clothes are incredibly comfortable during the summer but fade with time and turn an off white yellowish color. Wouldn't it be nice to have that brand new white pure color again for that clothing item you love? Soaking clothes in bleach is a tedious process that most people would prefer not to do but do everyone loves that brand new white look for their white clothing and sheets. 

## How will your project solve this problem?
SoakMe allows the user to simply open the app and request a pickup at their address of preference. From there they have a 24-hr turnaround to having that fresh white brand new look for their clothing, or bedding. The app takes away the hassle of bleaching your own laundry and allows anyone to have that brand new white clothing look!


## Map the user experience
To create a SoakMe account the user will create a login, password, and payment details. They can also upload a favorite address or customize their pickup location each order if they prefer. Once the user has logged in the landing page will be displayed. It will contain any current deals in their area as well as an option to see their existing orders or create a new order. Once they have selected a new order they can choose a pickup data, time and location and edit their payment info. They will have the option to add additional instructions to the order as well if they choose. Then they only have to submit the order, place their clothing somewhere accessible, and SoakMe will take it from there!
