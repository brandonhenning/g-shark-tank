#Project Proposal

* Update proposal.md with your proposal
* Project Description: Think "Elevator Pitch". Succinctly, but completely describe what you'll be building
* Problem Statement: What problem is your app solving? Who has it?
* How will your project solve the problem?
* Map the user experience. When the user opens your app, what happens? What information does your app need from your user? What does it output in return?
* List the technologies you plan to use. This should be a complete list, including APIs. Be prepared to defend the items on this list. This means you should research the technologies/APIs, and know why you're planning to use each.
